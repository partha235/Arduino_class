# Arduino_class
 Hello everyone! here i had made few codes for arduino class where i'm conducting. We all know about arduino as much a programable board in blue color. Most of us use Arduino UNO board, but i always recommend to have pro mini version of arduino. 
 
 The arduino software can be downloaded from its [official site](https://www.arduino.cc/).The arduino files comes with an extension ".ino". If you was good in command prompt use [arduino-cli](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.19/). Arduino use cpp version for code for microcontroller. Enormous  development board had been published in arduino. the frequently used one is atmega328 (in UNO,nano,pro mini ,etc.).
